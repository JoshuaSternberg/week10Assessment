# week10Assessment

Had a weird error with not putting in anything in the form feld and just hitting update. I thought when you used NOT NULL
it wasn't supposed to allow that but I guess I was wrong. Otherwise everything is working.

Doing the function call to the module in the route module was probably a bad choice, but I didn't know how or
where else to put it and how the relationship between those things worked out. No time!

Didn't include a .gitignore file due to time constraints. Sorry Antoinette!
